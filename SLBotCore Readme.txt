The purpose of this project is to create a bot template in C# for SecondLife using OpenMetaverse.

Step #1. OpenMetaverse has been precompiled for Windows and comes in a binary and zip format. The latest version was published Feb 2014.
Download OpenMetaverse from this link:
http://lib.openmetaverse.org/wiki/Download

Step #2. Place the DLL's in your C# project folder to keep everything tidy (it takes all of them, I haven't figured out which are not necessary.)

Step #3.   "Add references" to your C# project, so browse and add the DLL files.

Step #4. Copy the BotClass source code into your project as a new class, this should compile fine.

Step #5. Create a form. Instantiate a new  BotClass. Use the methods in the BotClass section.
